Filters are an important part for any ecommerce website. But building a good experience for users is far from being straightforward and can quickly become a challenge. With so much examples of filters out there, be aware of the best practices and mistakes to avoid requires a lot of research. But do not fear: I have spend a good amount of time reading and experimenting to be able to deliver common practices that you should use if building any new filter system or looking to improve it.

As for anything in User Experience, not one solution feets all needs but I wanted to try to established a baseline that you should be able to use and iterate if needed. I will primarly focus on user's perspective but keeping in mind the front-end approach and web accesssibility. As complex as filters could be, puting web accessibility in the center stage can only benefit in building an experience that works for everyone and will also be simple to build.

Why do we have filters?

Too many choices overwhelm people, making it easier for shoppers to reduce product options leads to increased conversion.
Filtering matches product discovery to shoppersâ€™ intent.
It makes eCommerce website navigation sweet and seamless.
Filters cut down on the time shoppers spend searching for products, leading to a quicker checkout.
