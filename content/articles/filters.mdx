Filters are an important part for any ecommerce website. But building a good experience for users is far from being straightforward and can quickly become a challenge. With so much examples of filters out there, be aware of the best practices and mistakes to avoid requires a lot of research. But do not fear: I have spend a good amount of time reading and experimenting to be able to deliver common practices that you should use if building any new filter system or looking to improve it.

As for anything in User Experience, not one solution feets all needs but I wanted to try to established a baseline that you should be able to use and iterate if needed.




Be category specific
