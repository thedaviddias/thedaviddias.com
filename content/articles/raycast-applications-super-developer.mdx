Spolight on Mac is great, but it always lacked the possibility to add custom commands and third party access. And that's where [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) comes in. It's a great application that allows you to do just that. I have been a big fan of "Alfred" at least since 2015. I would recommend this application to anyone who wants to be more productive on their Mac. I was a big fan!

But few months ago, one of my colleague talked to me about [Raycast](https://raycast.com/). Eager to always find better tools and expand my productivity, I decided to give it a try. The first thing I noticed was the speed. Not that "Alfred" is slow, but Raycast was just blazing fast!

I was hooked! And when I found out that all the applications were build in TypeScript, this was the cherry on the cake! After a few weeks now using it, I don't see myself going back.

And today, I wanted to share with you the 10 applications I use the most in Raycast, on a daily basis. Those applications are more towards developers but I highly recommend you to check Raycast out (it's free)

## One Password

[1Password](https://www.raycast.com/khasbilegt/1password) has been my password manager for many years. I can search, copy username or password, open the website. The only annoying part is the fact that [1Password](https://1password.com/) always ask me to give access to the application. Annoying but still useful.

## TailwindCSS Docs

I use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and nothing better than opening the TailwindCSS documentation directly from Raycast. I could search directly on the website but this saves me some clicks.

## Github

Open pull requests, notifications, discussions from [Github](https://www.raycast.com/raycast/github)... I can also search directly repositories from Raycast.

## Spotify

Play, pause, stop, next... I can [control Spotify](https://www.raycast.com/thomas/spotify-controls) directly from Raycast. This is something I was always using on Alfred, couldn't approve Raycast if I didn't have this option.

## Raindrop

Raindrops is my favourite bookmark manager. The kind of tool that constantly adds new features. I can search, open, add new bookmarks directly from Raycast with the [Raindrop](https://www.raycast.com/lardissone/raindrop-io) application.

## Vercel

I love seeing the status of [my deployment on Vercel](https://www.raycast.com/vercel/vercast) from Raycast. Can directly open my projects too.

## Visual Studio Code

I use "[Visual Studio Code](https://www.raycast.com/thomas/visual-studio-code)" Raycast App in combinaison with "[Project Manager](https://www.raycast.com/MarkusLanger/vscode-project-manager)" to quickly access all my projects in an instant.

## Bonus: Clipboard History

![](/images/articles/raycast-applications-super-developer/raycast-clipboard.jpg)

This is not an application, but a feature I loved on Alfred and actually exists on Raycast, even it's slighly less powerful.

"Clipboard History" give you access to your last copied items. I've assign the double `‚å•` (action) key to open the clipboard history. This is a feature I use constantly, and I'm glad it's available on Raycast.
