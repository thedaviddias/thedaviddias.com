I've recently spent some time working with Next.js projects. Once my projects are done, the next logical step is to deploy these apps to be accessible to the world.

I have naturally used the [Vercel platform](https://vercel.com/), which couldn't be easier to use and deploy your application with ease. Then I tried [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), which I particularly love but for now, requires you to use the [Serverless Framework](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/hosting/q/integration/next) if you want to benefit from Server Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities.

Then, I remembered that Netlify has added support for Next.js, including dynamic routes, Preview Mode and more around November 2020. It was time for me to try it! But I also wanted to have a real CI/CD in place, to test my code and do more actions before deploying to Netlify. That's where Github Actions came to the rescue!

I'm going to describe in this article, all the steps you need to take to deploy your Next.js application on Netlify using Github Actions.

> The full version of the project can be [found on Github](https://github.com/thedaviddias/next-netlify-github-actions-starter).

## Create a new Next.js App and push it to Github

As always, you need to have a recent version of Node and NPM installed on your machine. I personally recommend using `NVM` since it simplifies having multiple active Node.js versions.

To create a new Next.js project, type this command in your CLI:

```bash
npx create-next-app name-of-your-app

# move into the app's root directory
cd ~/path-to-projects/name-of-your-app/
```

This will install a new application using a basic Next.js boilerplate. Don't forget to move to your app root folder before launching any next commands.

Once your Next.js project is locally created, you can create a new project on Github and push the code generated.

_(For those you are new to coding, feel free to [follow these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) to create a new repository on Github.)_

## Setting up your Netlify project

There are 2 ways of creating a new Netlify project:

- Creating a project online [here](https://app.netlify.com/)
- Using the Netlify CLI.

Let's use the CLI this time, I'm sure you already created a new project in the past using the Netlify interface.

Let's start by installing `netlify-cli` globally:

```bash
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

Then check if the installation succeeds, confirming with this command:

```bash
netlify
```

### Netlify account authentication

Now you need to link your computer with your Netlify account. To authenticate with Netlify, you need to run this command:

```bash
netlify login
```

This will open a new tab in your browser where you'll need to "Authorize your Application" and then grant access to Netlify CLI.

In case you already logged in previously, the console will output:

```bash
Already logged in via netlify config on your machine
```

### Netlify project creation

Now that your CLI is authorized to communicate with your Netlify account, it's time to programmatically create a new project:

```bash
# create a new Netlify site using the Netlify shortcut: ntl
ntl init
```

The first question you are asked is if you want to connect this directory to an existing Netlify site or create & configure a new site. Choose **Create & configure a new site**:

![Connect to an existing directory or create and configure a new site](/images/blog/connect-existing-direction.jpeg)

Then you have to choose your **team**:

![Question about the name of the team](/images/blog/question-name-team.jpeg)

Choose the **name of your application**:

![Screenshot of the CLI asking for the name of your application](/images/blog/cli-name-application.jpeg)

After entering the name of your project, the site is created and few URLs populated the CLI which gave you access to your admin URL, the URL of your site and the Site ID. Keep the site ID aside, you will need that number later on.

For the next 3 questions (build, start and function), **insert a space**. We are not going to directly use the NPM scripts, our Github actions will later trigger each command.
![Screenshot of the CLI with the build, start and function script command suggestion](/images/blog/cli-build-start-function-script.jpeg)

Finally, automatically create a netlify.toml file, which we will edit later. If your respond no, you can still create that file manually at the root of your project.

![Screenshot of the CLI asking to create a netlify.toml file](/images/blog/automatically-create-netlify-toml.jpeg)

Once you provided an answer to all the questions, your terminal should look like this:

![Screenshot of the CLI after all the questions are answered](/images/blog/cli-after-all-questions-answered.jpeg)

## Updating our Netlify project

It's now time to change some options on our Netlify project. Open directly your project on Netlify with this command:

```bash
ntl open
```

![Screenshot of the Netlify project created](/images/blog/netlify-project-created.jpeg)

You should see that our production deployment failed. You don't have to worry, this is totally normal. We need to disable our automatic build because our Github Actions will take care of it.

Go in your Settings > Build & deploy. Click on `Edit settings` and `Stop builds`. Save.

Just below, go to the `Deploy contexts` section and select `None` for the Deploy previews.

Don't worry, like the build, we will create our preview URL using Github actions.

## Enable server-side rendering on Netlify

If you have been using Next.js you are aware of the capability to do the server-side rendering. But usually, you will need to configure a Node server and that's something we don't want to have to deal with. Around October 2020, the Netlify team started working on `next-on-netlify`, a utility to enable SSR in Next.js on Netlify. That's what we are going to use here.

_(In case you are not interested in Github Actions and want to use Netlify to build your project, take a look at how to use the [Next on Netlify Plugin](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-nextjs). It directly wraps your Next.js app and doesn't need as much configuration as we are going to explain.)_

Let's start by installing our utility:

```bash
npm install -D next-on-netlify
```

### Set Next.js target to serverless

We must build our Next.js app as a serverless app

```javascript:next.config.js
module.exports = {
  // Target must be serverless
  target: "serverless",
};
```

### Add a post build hook

We need to add a `postbuild` command that is automatically triggered after our `build` command finishes. `next-on-netlify` does a lot of "magic" to copy and set up our Next.js app to be correctly hosted on Netlify.

```bash:package.json
{
  "name": "next-netlify-github-actions-starter",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "postbuild": "next-on-netlify"
  },
  ...
}
```

### Configure Netlify

Remember the file that was automatically created and called `netlify.toml`? You can remove all the boilerplate and replace it with only this code (be careful in respecting the indentation):

```toml:netlify.toml
[build]
  command   = ""
  functions = "out_functions"
  publish   = "out_publish"
```

Technically, when `next-on-netlify` will run, it will take what is in these folders and host it on Netlify. **_DO NOT CHANGE_** the name of these folders as these are hardcoded into the utility.

Don't forget to add these line to your `.gitignore` file

```git:.gitignore
# Netlify build
out_*
```

You can commit your files. Let's work now on the Github Actions configuration.

## Github Actions configuration

The netlify configuration is now done, all dependencies installed, it's time to configure our Github actions which will test, build and deploy our Next.js application to Netlify. But before that, we need to set up some Github secrets that we will need in our GH Actions.

Go to your `Github project > Settings > Secrets > New repository secret`

| Actions secret name  | Comments                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` | Request your token [here](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens) |
| `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`    | The site to where deploy your site (get it from the API ID on your Site Settings)           |

![Screenshot of the Actions secrets page on Github](/images/blog/actions-secrets-netlify.jpeg)

Create a new file called `main.yml` inside `.github/workflows`. Copy-paste the following code and read the explanation of it after this snippet.

```yml:.github/workflows/main.yml
name: Main workflow

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
      - main
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Cache node modules and next folder
      - name: 📬 Caching
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: |
            **/node_modules
            ${{ github.workspace }}/.next/cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

      - name: Use Node.js 14.x
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 14.x

      - name: 🧰 Install dependencies
        run: npm run install

      - name: 📦 Build project
        run: npm run build --if-present

      # - name: 🧹 Run lint
      #   run: npm run lint

      # - name: 🐛 Run tests
      #   run: npm run test

      # Deploy to Netlify with a personalized message
      - name: 🚀 Deploy to Netlify
        id: deploy-netlify
        uses: netlify/actions/cli@master
        env:
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
        with:
          args: deploy -m 'v${{ steps.package-version.outputs.current-version}} ・ ${{ github.head_ref }}'
```

### Detailed explanation of the main workflow file

1. **_Give a name_** to your Github action
2. Choose which **_type of the event_** should trigger this action, you can use push instead of pull_request, it's up to you.
3. Specify on **_which system_** this action should be launched, I choose the latest version of Ubuntu (Linux).
4. **_Checkout your code_**
5. **_Cache your node modules_** and the .next/cache folder. When you will first run this action, it will take some time. On the second launch, the action will take the modules that exist in the cache and will then proceed way faster.
6. Specify the **_version of Node_** you want to use, in my case, I choose the most recent version of Node 14th.
7. **_Install the dependencies_** of your project.
8. **_Build your project_**. Remember that after the build, the post-build command will be launch. This is what you should see in the `build` logs in your Github Action tab:
   ![Screenshot of the build-in Github Action](/images/blog/build-in-github-action-netlify.jpeg)
9. I added lint and test commands, which I commented. You can use these to trigger ESLint, Jest (even Cypress) or any other plugin that ensures your code doesn't have any issue.
10. Finally, we trigger the Netlify deployment to deploy our Next.js app to Netlify. 🎉

![Screenshot of all Github actions](/images/blog/all-github-actions-netlify.jpeg)

You may have seen an argument passed to the Netlify deploy:

```yml:.github/workflows/main.yml
args: deploy -m 'v${{ steps.package-version.outputs.current-version}} ・ ${{ github.head_ref }}'
```

This will add a message for each Deploy Preview, a way to keep track of which PR generated which Deploy.

![Screenshot of the Deploy page on Netlify](/images/blog/deploy-netlify-preview.jpeg)

On the same deploy page, you can click on the Deploy Preview and access your app using the preview URL.

A better way would be to use another task to automatically populate your pull request with the log and preview URL. At the end of your file, add this action:

```yml:.github/workflows/main.yml
# Publish the inspect and preview link to the PR
- name: 👓 Netlify Preview URL
  uses: unsplash/comment-on-pr@master
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    OUTPUT: "This pull request is being automatically deployed to Netlify.\n\n🔍 Inspect: ${{ steps.deploy-netlify.outputs.NETLIFY_LOGS_URL }}\n✅ Preview: ${{ steps.deploy-netlify.outputs.NETLIFY_URL }}"
  with:
    msg: ${{ env.OUTPUT }}
    check_for_duplicate_msg: false
```

This will automatically create a comment in your PR.
