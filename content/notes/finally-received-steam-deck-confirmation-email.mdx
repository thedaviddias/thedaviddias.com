This was a long wait! After months of lurring on Youtube watching others playing with their Deck, I finally got **my purchase confirmation email** for the Steam Deck!

What kept me sane during this time was probably [this tool](https://getmydeck.ingenhaag.dev/s/US/256/1626745255) created by [Labidou51](https://www.reddit.com/u/Labidou51). I was able to get a sense of when I would receive the email confirmation.

Some more days to wait and I hope to get this new amazing piece of tech (it's a computer) in my own hands! Maybe I can find a [nice skin on Dbrand](https://dbrand.com/shop/steam-deck-skins) in the meantime ðŸ˜œ?!
