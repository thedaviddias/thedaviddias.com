If you want to prevent bots like ChatGPT from scraping and parsing a website, the robots.txt file is the one to update.

This is the file usually used to tell search engines which pages to index and which ones to ignore. In this case, you can use it to block AI bots or in that case, specifically ChatGPT. The only caveat is that it can't remove pages that have already been indexted.

Simply add the following line in your `robots.txt` file:

```
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /
```

This code snippet will tell ChatGPT that it is not allowed to access any part or page of the site.

Whatever ChatGPT and Open AI actually respect this standard is up to them, but it's a good start. Of course, it may not be enough to prevent unwanted scraping and parsing and you may want to put in place additional measures such as implementing CAPTCHAs, using a content security policy, etc...
