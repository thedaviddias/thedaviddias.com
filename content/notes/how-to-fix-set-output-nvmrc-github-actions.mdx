You may be getting the issue **"The `set-output` command is deprecated and will be disabled soon. Please upgrade to using Environment Files."** from your Github workflow.

Few months ago, I choose to update some of my Github workflows to read from my `.nvmrc` file instead of manually specifying my node version.

```.bash:.github/workflows/production.yml
on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Detect Node version
        run: echo ::set-output name=NODE_VERSION::$(cat .nvmrc)
        id: nvmrc

      - name: Use Node.js ${{ steps.nvmrc.outputs.NODE_VERSION }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ steps.nvmrc.outputs.NODE_VERSION }}
```

But [since October 2022](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/) and the runner version `2.298.2`, Github shows a warning regarding a future depreciation of the `set-output` command.

After few trials, I figured out how to update using the `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` instead:

```.bash:.github/workflows/update-production.yml
on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Detect Node version
        run: echo "NODE_VERSION=$(cat .nvmrc)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        id: nvmrc
        # shell: bash (to be added if you use composite actions)

      - name: Use Node.js ${{ steps.nvmrc.outputs.NODE_VERSION }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '${{ steps.nvmrc.outputs.NODE_VERSION }}'
```

And "voil√†", the warning should have disappeared and you should see the number of the version right after `Use Node.js XXXX` in your workflow.
