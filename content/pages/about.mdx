Hi there! I'm David Dias.

I was born and raised in France by my
parents native from Portugal. In my early twenties, I moved to
Brazil where I lived from 2006 to 2009. Back to France, I moved to
Paris where I started working in digital agencies. In 2015, I was
sent to Mauritius by my company for a two years contract. Then I
moved to Toronto in June 2018 where I'm currently living.
