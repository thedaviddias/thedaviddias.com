Big shout-out to all the awesome folks and amazing companies that are backing my open-source projects on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/thedaviddias) and [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/thedaviddias). You guys rock!

Your support seriously makes a huge difference, and it's what keeps me coding away. This page is all about you - a massive thank you for being part of my journey and cheering me on!
