## Overview

The Frontend Checklist is an exhaustive list of all elements needed to have a thorough checked before launching any website on production. Hosted at frontendchecklist.io, the checklist includes everything from the essentials and accessibility, to SEO, performance and more.

## Key Details

- **Initial Date**: The start date of the project
- **Status**: Completed
- **Technologies**: Markdown, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Problem Statement

My initial problem was tied to my personnal situation: as I was leaving Mauritius and my entire team of front-end developers, I wanted to make sure that they could continue to deliver high quality work without me. Turned out that the content I created for them was also useful for so many other developers and companies around the world.

## Goals

The main goal of the Front-End Checklist is to provide a comprehensive, accessible resource for frontend developers, covering all aspects of frontend development. All the elements that needs to be checked before launching a website or a web application.

## Approach

I did a lot of research in 2017 to find other checklists. But the few I found at the time were outdated or incomplete. So I decided to create my own checklist, based on my experience and I had the chance to learn trough the years and the projects I worked on.

## Progress

The Front-End Checklist project is currently completed and in the maintenance phase. I have been promissing for a long time a version 2.0, but I am still working on it.

## Challenges and Learnings

To this day, the Front-End Checklist has not less than 65,000 stars on Github and translated in 14 languages!

I learned a lot about the open-source community and how to manage a project with so many contributors.

## Conclusion / Reflection

The Front-End Checklist turned to be a valuable resource for many frontend developers around the world.
